# ZCollective

ZCollective is a tool used to configure Zabbix using data discovered using
MCollective.

At [The Scale Factory](http://www.scalefactory.com/), we've used Zabbix for
monitoring for some time.  Our main complaint with this software has been that
configuration has always been a bit too GUI-focussed.  This has been addressed
in recent releases with an improvement in the functionality exposed via the API.

We've written ZCollective to remove some of the GUI legwork required in
configuring monitoring for individual hosts - we think it's a cleaner
alternative to Zabbix host discovery.

## How does it work?

First of all, ZCollective connects to the Zabbix API to fetch a list of
templates that Zabbix knows about.  These have been constructed in the usual
way inside the Zabbix UI, and given the same name as the configuration
management class they support.

It then pulls a list of hosts, interfaces and templates for each host
configured in Zabbix.

Then it uses MCollective to build a view of the hosts on your infrastructure.  
For each host, it fetches a name, some IP address details and a list of
configuration management classes associated with the node.

Hosts that are found by MCollective but are not monitored will be added to
Zabbix, and linked to any templates that match configuration management class
names.  Double-colons are substituted for underscores when matching
configuration management class names to template names.

Hosts found in Zabbix but not by MCollective are left alone, but reported on.

Hosts found in both Zabbix and MCollective will be linked to any missing
templates.  IP address mismatches for the hostname are reported on, but no
changes are made.

## Template Aliasing and Extra Templates

Optionally, ZCollective can use the `zabbix_template` MCollective plugin to
interrogate each host for a list of alternative and extra templates to use for
configuration management classes installed on that host.

Aliasing can be very useful, for example, to use a different template on a
specific host, if it is a replication master rather than a slave. It can also
be handy, if you have a class that is installed on every host, to use that to
ensure the ```Template OS Linux``` Zabbix template is linked to that host by
ZCollective.

To configure a template alias on a host, put a file in
`/etc/zabbix/template_aliases/` named after the configuration management class
you wish to be aliased. That file should contain a single line, which is the
name of the Zabbix template that should be used instead.

For example, we have a `scalefactory::packages` Puppet module which is
installed on all of our hosts. In that module, we write out a file
`/etc/zabbix/template_aliases/scalefactory_packages` which contains the text
`Template OS Linux`. This ensures that this standard Zabbix template is linked
to all hosts.

To specify extra templates to be linked to the host for a given module, put a
file in `/etc/zabbix/template_extras/` named after the configuration
management class. Add extra templates, one per line, to this file.

This can be useful to add monitoring for optional features of a configuration
management class. For example, our Apache puppet module contains a Zabbix
template which monitors port 80 by default. If SSL is turned on, we use this
extra template feature to ensure that checks are also made for Apache listening
on port 443.

Use of the `zabbix_template` plugin is completely optional, and ZCollective
will work perfectly without it.

## Hostgroups based on collectives

Any subcollectives declared in mcollective's client.cfg will be added as
hostgroups to zabbix; the machines discovered via mcollective will be assigned
to these hostgroups.

## Usage

```
Usage: zcollective [options]
        --zabbix-api-url url         JSON-RPC endpoint for zabbix server
        --zabbix-user user           Zabbix API username
        --zabbix-pass pass           Zabbix API password
        --debug                      Enable debugging
        --noop                       Don't make changes
        --interface-cidr CIDR        Only consider interfaces matching the given CIDR
        --connect-by-ip              When adding new hosts, get Zabbix to connect to those hosts by
                                     IP address instead of hostname. Useful in scenarios where you
                                     don't have control over your DNS.
        --lockfile=f                 Use alternative lock file
        --timeout=t                  Time out after number of seconds
        --host host                  Ignore mcollective discovery, use this host
        --template template          Add this template (only with --host)
        --ignore-classes c1,c2       Skip hosts containing given puppet classes
        --hostgroup-facts f1,f2      Create hostgroups and link hosts for given facts
        --insecure-https             Don't validate the SSL cert
        --auto-zabbix-inventory      Enable Zabbix auto-inventory mode for the discovered hosts
```

The URL, username and password options are self-explanatory.

`--interface-cidr`, if passed will filter the interfaces MCollective finds by
CIDR range.  This is useful for multihomed hosts where you only want to monitor
the interface on an administrative network.

`--debug` will generate a lot of console noise, but helps with working out 
what's going on.

Passing `--noop` will report on the changes to be made, but not make any.

Using `--host` allows you to add a host outside of the scope of mcollective,
for example an Amazon RDS or Elasticache instance, to Zabbix. Passing the
`--template` switch at the same time will add a template to that host in
Zabbix. When using the `--host` option, the given host will be added to the
"ZCollective Discovered Hosts" hostgroup only.

Passing a list of facts to `--hostgroup-facts` will result in ZCollective
creating a Zabbix hostgroup per matching fact discovered by MCollective. It
will then assign hosts to hostgroups based on the same facts. (e.g. given an
example fact of osfamily=Debian and passing `--hostgroup-facts osfamily` to
ZCollective. You will end up with a new hostgroup named Debian containing hosts
with that fact)

Using `--insecure-https` will pass VERIFY_NONE OpenSSL, permitting the use
of insecure or self-signed certificates. _Use this at your own risk_.

Using `--auto-zabbix-inventory` will enable Automatic Inventory Mode for
discovered hosts. This is useful if you have templates linking items to host
inventory.

## Example

A run against a fresh Zabbix install on a modest infrastructure, using the
default username/password:

```
$ ./zcollective.rb --zabbix-api-url http://zabbix/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php --interface-cidr 10.0.44.0/24 
I, [2012-11-21T16:43:32.899696 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-live-db2 found by mcollective but not in zabbix

I, [2012-11-21T16:43:33.103389 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-core2 found by mcollective but not in zabbix
I, [2012-11-21T16:43:33.456250 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-core2 added as ID 100100000010159 with 5 templates
I, [2012-11-21T16:43:33.456342 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-core1 found by mcollective but not in zabbix
I, [2012-11-21T16:43:33.823787 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-core1 added as ID 100100000010160 with 5 templates
I, [2012-11-21T16:43:33.823875 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-log1 found by mcollective but not in zabbix
I, [2012-11-21T16:43:33.997864 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-log1 added as ID 100100000010161 with 2 templates
I, [2012-11-21T16:43:33.998029 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-live-app2 found by mcollective but not in zabbix
I, [2012-11-21T16:43:34.316868 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-live-app2 added as ID 100100000010162 with 4 templates
I, [2012-11-21T16:43:34.317034 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-live-app1 found by mcollective but not in zabbix
I, [2012-11-21T16:43:34.654262 #8727]  INFO -- : Host ljn-live-app1 added as ID 100100000010163 with 4 templates
```

A second run against the same infrastructure returns nothing on the
commandline, as nothing is modified.

If we remove a couple of templates from ljn-live-app1 and run again:

```
$ ./zcollective.rb --zabbix-api-url http://zabbix/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php --interface-cidr 10.0.44.0/24 
I, [2012-11-21T16:48:59.915380 #10272]  INFO -- : Zabbix ljn-live-app1 not linked to a template for sf_varnish
I, [2012-11-21T16:48:59.915588 #10272]  INFO -- : Zabbix ljn-live-app1 not linked to a template for sf_apache
I, [2012-11-21T16:49:00.184213 #10272]  INFO -- : Added missing templates to ljn-live-app1
```

## Caveats

Beware of running zcollective against puppet runs implemented using the 'puppet
apply' runmode: due to a known issue/bug in puppet
(http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/7917), the classes.txt file, which
mcollective (and by extention zcollective) uses to classify machines, isn't
written. Only use zcollective on infrastructures where you're using the 'puppet
agent' runmode, or find another way to populate classes.txt (eg using the
`--write-catalog-summary` switch in new versions of puppet) so that mcollective
can correctly classify your nodes.

When using `--host`, the IP address for that host's interface in Zabbix
will not be populated. This is because in many contexts for the expected use
case, eg. Amazon RDS and Elasticache instances, the IP address is variable and
the DNS end point name should always be used. As such, the
`--connect-by-ip` option is not valid when using `--host`.

## Assumptions

Because we wrote this to scratch our own itch, we've made assumptions that may
only hold for a Scale Factory zabbix setup.

We assume that your Zabbix hosts are named the same as the hostname of the
monitored server - so `ljn-live-web1.scalefactory.net` will be referred to
as `ljn-live-web1` by Zabbix.

## Requirements

You need to be runing Zabbix >=2.0,  MCollective >=2.2, and Facter >=1.6.14.
You'll also need the netaddr Ruby Gem.

## "Missing features"

ZCollective currently doesn't know how to cope with hosts that are only visible
to Zabbix via a proxy.

Giving a password on the commandline isn't very secure.

ZCollective has only been tested against a small number of use cases - use it
at your own risk.
